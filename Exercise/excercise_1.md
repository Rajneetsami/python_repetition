## 0. Pythagorean theorem (*)

a) A right angled triangle has the catheti: a = 3 and b = 4 length units. Compute the hypothenuse of the triangle. (\*)

b) A right angled triangle has hypothenuse c = 7.0 and a cathetus a = 5.0 length units. Compute the other cathetus and round to one decimal. (\*)

## 1. Classification accuracy (\*)

A machine learning algorithm has been trained to predict whether or not it would rain the next day. Out of 365 predictions, it got 300 correct, compute the accuracy of this model.

## 2. Classification accuracy (\*)

A machine learning model has been trained to detect fire. Here is the result of its predictions:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>True Positive (TP)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: fire</li>
        <li>Number of TP: 2</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>False Positive (FP)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: no fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: fire</li>
        <li>Number of FP: 2</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>False Negative (FN)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: no fire</li>
        <li>Number of FN: 11</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>True Negative (TN)
      <ul>
        <li>Reality: no fire</li>
        <li>Predicted: no fire</li>
        <li>Number of TN: 985</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Calculated the accuracy using the following formula:

$\text{accuracy} = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$

Is this a good model? Why? Why not?

## 3. File metadata - format print (*)

There is a file with the following metadata:

- name: orders_data.csv
- file size: 3.14mb
- modified 2024

Create variables for each of them and print out the following to the screen

```
=== File metadata ===
Filename: sales_data.csv
Size (MB): 24.7
Last Modified Year: 2023
```

## 4. Unit converter - inch to cm (*)

Screen sizes are defined using inches for example my computer has 15'' and it corresponds to the diagonal of the screen. Let the user type in a value in inches and output the result in centimeters.

## 5. Count characters in a text (*)

Create a program to let a user input a text, count the number of characters and print it out to the screen. Space can also be counted as a character here.

Hint: `len()` function

## 6. Data types (*)

Create variables of type bool, int, float, str and list. Then use `type` function and check each variables type.

```
radius = 5 has type <class 'int'>
PI = 3.1415 has type <class 'float'>
cool_subject = 'math' has type <class 'str'>
is_cool = True has type <class 'bool'>
numbers = [1, 2, 41, 2] has type <class 'list'>
```

## 7. Theory

a) What is the difference between input() and print() in Python?

b) What data type does the input() function return by default? How can you use it to get numeric input?

c) Explain how formatted string literals (f-strings) improve readability in output statements. Give an example.

d) Can a variable change its data type during runtime in Python? Show an example.

e) What does it mean that Python is "dynamically typed"? How is that different from statically typed languages?
