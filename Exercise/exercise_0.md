# Exercise 0 - Git and github repositories

In this exercise, you get to familiarize yourself with git and github which are essential tools for every developer.

> [!NOTE]
> Usually it's easier to create a repo in github and then clone it down to local filesystem, preferably in a folder called github. Then after you're done with your work for the day commit and push the changes to github.

## . Theoretical exercises

a) What is the difference between git and github?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track code changes locally, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and enables collaboration among developers.

b) What is the purpose of .gitignore file?

The .gitignore file tells Git which files or directories should not be tracked or committed to the repository. It is mainly used to avoid committing temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information like API keys

c) Why is it a good idea to work with git and github?

Git provides version control to track and manage code changes, while GitHub enables collaboration and remote storage. Together, they help teams work efficiently, maintain history, experiment safely using branches, and revert to previous versions when needed.
